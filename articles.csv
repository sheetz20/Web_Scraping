Emotions,"Losing herself in chaos couldn’t make her forget fears,only pillows know the story behind her beautiful smile.She kept on trying to find odds about the things she was trying to run away andended up realising, things are meant to chase her,until she dusts away fears and learns to fly alone."
Desire,"When all this is over I desire to live my life to the fullest enjoying every single thing and doing all adventures of life till my adrenaline level goes up. I wanna watch the sunset until it disappears behind the clouds, I wanna feel sound of waves again, I strive to chase fog, thinking it will lead me somewhere.I ought to live not one, but many lives in one lifetime.I wanna scribble endless stories of adventures,I wish to experience the idea of being in love with my favourite person. Wanna make this imperfect life little perfect."
Nostalgia,"With no sense of time and it’s passing,I was sitting with tangled hair and wonderingwish I could go back to the times when child within me lived in the world of cartoon characters and imagine being one of them.All those imaginary thoughts made me happy, today when I find myself lost in chaos and chasing those stories once I scribbled without even thinking, that dream of becoming a girl who loves to live life in bits and pieces to resonate in itself."
The Journey Begins,"Thanks for joining me! 
Good company in a journey makes the way seem shorter. — Izaak Walton"
